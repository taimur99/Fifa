# FIFA Players Data Analysis

This project is about analyzing FIFA players' data using Python. It shows basic data skills like reading a CSV file, checking the data, and making simple visualizations.

## Files

- `project.ipynb`: The main notebook with all the code.
- `players_20.csv`: The data file used in this project.

## Whatâ€™s Inside

- Read and display FIFA players' data
- Look at basic player info like name, age, height, weight, club, and nationality
- Use Python libraries like:
  - `pandas` (for data handling)
  - `numpy` (for math)
  - `matplotlib` and `seaborn` (for charts and graphs)

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python installed
2. Open the notebook with Jupyter Notebook or VS Code
3. Run the cells step by step

## Skills Learned

- Working with CSV files
- Using Pandas and Numpy
- Basic data visualization
- Exploring real-world data
